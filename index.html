Introduction
</h3>

<p>
<p>When a photon interacts with matter, it can undergo either absorption, reflection or transmission. The Ultraviolet-visible-NearInfraRed (UV-vis-NIR) spectrophotometer can be used to probe these interactions by irradiating the sample with photons of wavelength in the UV-vis range (200 - 900 nm) and NIR range (900 - 3000 nm). The operating range of the spectrophotometer can be expressed in different units. In wavelengths it is from 200 nm to 3000 nm, or 0.2 microns to 3 microns, or 2000 angstroms to 30,000 angstroms; in wavenumbers it is  from 50,000 cm-1 to 3333 cm-1; in frequencies it is from 1.5 x 10^15 Hz to 1 x 10^14 Hz; in energy it is from 6.2 eV to 0.41 eV. The lower limit of the wavelength is determined by the sensitivity of the detector and the upper limit is determined by the radiation source.</p>
<p>UV vis spectroscopy helps to understand the optical properties of the material such as its reflectance and transmittace over a specified wavelength range. It can also be used to identify the cutoff where the energy of the photon is higher than the bandgap of the sample and the sample begins to absorb the incoming photon. Presence of chromophores in the sample also gives rise to absorbance peaks which can be readily identified throguh the UV vis spectroscopy. Complemented by the FTIR spectrum, UV vis spectrscopy porvides a complete picture of the different vibrational and excitational modes present in the sample.</p>
In this laboratory, the Agilent Cary5000 spectropohotometer was used to characterize the optical properties of glasses of different compositions. THe samples used were Sodalime silicate glass, Arsenic Sulfide (As2S3) glass, Arsenic Selenide glass (As2Se3), and a thin film pf plastic. The exercise also helps to characterize the spectral performance of the spectrophotometer.

Instrumentation
</h3>
<h4>
Sources
</h4>
<p>
<p>Typically an UV vis spectrophotometer has two sources, one for visble to NIR range and one for the UV range.</p>
<p>Sources for visble to NIR range:</p>
<ul>
<li>tungsten lamps</li>
<li>xenon arc lamps</li>
<li>mercury vapor lamps</li>
</ul>
<p>Sources for UV range:</p>
<ul>
<li>deuterium lamps</li>
<li>xenon arc and flash lamps</li>
</ul>
<p>Tungsten lamps can be designed to either operate in vacuum or in the present of an inert gas with certain amount of halogens sealed inside a quartz envelope. The inert gas and halogen is added to slow down the deterioration of tungsten. In a tungsten halogen lamp, the tungsten filament is heated by passing current through it. The inert gas cools the filament and suppresses evaporation. The halogen, usually bromine, reacts with the evaporated tungsten on walls of the quartz envelope and deposits back on the filament and thus prolonging its life. Tungsten lamps are the most popular source for wavelengths in the visible to NIR range, 0.3 microns to 3 microns.</p>
<p>Xenon arc lamps work by ionizing Xenon between two tungsten electrodes at high voltages. The ionized Xenon emits radiation due to gas discharge. when it collides with other neutral atoms and comes back to its ground state. Xenon lamps can provide light source the at covers both UV and visible range, from 0.19 microns to 1.1 microns. But they are much more expensive that tungsten lamps and must be operated at high pressure.</p>
<p>Mercury vapor lamps are similar to Xenon lamps in that they too work by the principle of gas discharge. However the mercury is initially present in liquid state and has to converted to vapor before operation of the lamp. This is a slow process taking 7-8 minutes before the lamp is operational.</p>
<p>The deuterium lamp also operates by a similar principle. The tube is filled with deuterium gas and an arc is created between a tungsten electrode and nickel by holding the electrodes at high voltages. This ionizes deuterium leading to light emission due to gas discharge. The advantage of deuterium over the other sources listed here are that it can provide high intensities in the UV range and have a longer life span. Deuterium emits wavelengths of UV range from 0.1 to 0.9 microns. The intensities at different wavelengths for each source is shown in Fig1.</p>
The instrument used during the experiment was Cary5000 spectropohotometer from Agilent. It has two sources for irradiation: deuterium arc for the UV range and tungsten halogen for the visible range. <a href="https://www.avantes.com/support/theoretical-background/introduction-to-light-sources/">[Ref 1]</a><a href="https://www.gmp.ch/spectroscopy/light-source-for-spectroscopy/high-power-light-sources-deuterium-xenon-tungsten-halogen">[Ref 2]</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1046-2023(02)00204-9">[Ref 3]</a>

<h4>
Detectors
</h4>
<p>
The typical requirement for detectors in UV vis spectrophotometers is to convert photons that fall on it to electric signal. An ideal detector must have wide wavelength range, high sensitivity, low noise, and fast response. The different types of detectors can be classified into photomultipliers (PMT), photodiode detector arrays (PDA), charge coupled devices (CCD), and paired emitter detector diodes (PEDD). Photomultiplier tubes consist of a series of dynodes stacked between a cathode and an anode. The incoming photon from the sample hits the cathode which causes it to emit electrons. The resulting electrons strike each dynode which releases further secondary electrons thus multiplying the original signal. Finally the electrons strike the anode where they are converted to electrical signal. PMTs are the most common type of detectors in spectrophotometers because of their high sensitivity and resolution. In PDAs, photodiodes are charged and stacked in arrays. When photon strikes the detector, the diodes lose their charge and the current required to recharge them is measured as being proportional to photon strength. The advantage of PDA is that it can monitor all wavelengths and can be used as multichannel detectors. Since they are very fast they can be used to detect transient signals as well. However they often have high noise ratios which limit their application. The detection range for PDAs depend on the bandgap of diodes used. Si diode can be used to detect from 0.1 to 1 microns whereas PbS or InGaAs  detectors can be used to detect wavelengths between 1 micron to 2 micron. CCD work by using a Si chip that absorbs the incoming photon and emits a single electron. CCD based detectors contain arrays of Si and the resulting electron emission is recorded . CCD detectors have low read noise and high quantum efficiency. PEDDs are similar to LEDs but operate in the reverse. The incoming photon when it impacts the diode gives rise to electric current that is proportional to light strength. They offer several advantages such as high sensitivity, high SNR ration and large operating range. The instrument operated during the ab session used Si diodes for detection in the UV range and PbS detectors for detection in the vis and NIR range. <a href="%5Bhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263224118311904">[Ref 4]</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.saa.2016.09.037">[Ref 5]</a>

<h4>
Grating Monochromator
</h4>
<p>
A monochromator disperses the collimated light coming through the entrance slit by making them fall on a diffraction grating. Different wavelengths of the light gets diffracted to different angles because of the grating and only a narrow wavelength range is allowed to exit the setup and travel to the detector. The other portion of the wavelength can be selected by rotating the grating. The number of lines per unit length on the grating determines its resolution. The resolving power is given by the equation, $$ \frac{\lambda}{\delta\lambda} = nN $$ where n is the order of diffraction and N is the is the number of lines in the grating. A double monochromator is when the light exiting the monochromator is made to pass through another monochromator (or through the same monochromator again) to eliminate stray light. Stray light is caused due to undesired scattering inside the monochromator or due to the environment. Other false light may arise due to the sample fluorescence. Typically stray light is in the order of 10^-3 of the incoming light intensity. <a href="https://www.technologynetworks.com/analysis/articles/the-monochromator-and-its-role-in-the-spectrograph-369390">[Ref 6]</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.saa.2016.09.037">[Ref 7]</a>
</p>
<h4>
Slit width
</h4>
<p>
The light that comes from a monochromator is not perfectly monochromatic and contains a range of wavelengths. This range is determined by the slit width. The slit width therefore a critical parameter that determines the throughput and resolution of the spectrophotometer. A large width allows more light through the sample and can give better quality data and less noise, but will not resolve narrow or close together sample peaks. Using a smaller width will provide better resolving power but can result in increased data collection times to achieve the same data quality due to less light reaching the sample. The slit width and the diffraction angle are related by the equation, $$\Delta\lambda = \frac{d \cos \beta}{nf} \Delta x = nN $$ where <span class="math inline">\(\beta\) is the diffraction angle and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \lambda\)</span> are the slit width and bandwidth respectively. Since the diffraction angle is directly proportional to the wavelength based on Bragg’s equation, it decreases with decreasing wavelength. Therefore inorder to maintain constant resolution, the slit width has to increase with decresing wavelength.

<h3>
Calculation of transmission and thickness
</h3>
<p>Absorption coefficient ϵ = <span class="math inline">\(10 m^{-1} mole\% ^{-1}\)</span> <br>
Absorbance = <span class="math inline">\(-log(I/I_0)\)</span> = ϵ c x, where c is concentration and x is the thickness.<br>
Since transmittance, T% = <span class="math inline">\(I/I_0 * 100\)</span>, it implies that Absorbance = 2 - log T%.</p>
<p>At initial concentration (<span class="math inline">\(c_{init}\)</span>), <br>
<span class="math inline">\(log T\% = 10^{-2}*c_{init}\)</span> at 1 mm , <br>
<span class="math inline">\(log T\% = 10^{-1}*c_{init}\)</span> at 1 cm and <br>
<span class="math inline">\(log T\% = 1*c_{init}\)</span> at 10 cm. <br>
When the concentration is tripled (3*c_init), <br>
<span class="math inline">\(log T\% = 3*10^{-2}*c_{init}\)</span> at 1 mm ,<br>
<span class="math inline">\(3*10^{-1}*c_{init}\)</span> at 1 cm and <br>
<span class="math inline">\(3*1*c_{init}\)</span> at 10 cm. <br>
To maintain constant level of transmission at <span class="math inline">\(10^{-1}*c_{init}\)</span>, when the concentration is tripled, the thickness must be reduced by 1/3 of it’s initial value, (0.333 cm).</p>

Testing samples
</h3>
<h4>
Sample : Sodalime Silicate glass
</h4>
<p>
<p>Before testing the sample, a hundred percent line data is collected from the instrument to check its performance. The usual transmittance data from the instrument is not flat. Therefore the HPL must be corrected. The noise in the HPL is very low S:N::100:0.05. 
<figure><img src = "4_HPL.png" width="350" height="250"><figcaption>Hundred percent line of the instrument</figcaption></figure>
A sodalime silicate glass slide of approximately 1 mm thickness was used as the sample. It is observed that the UV cutoff happens at 290 nm which is expected based on the bandgap of the material. It can also be expressed as 0.29 microns, 344782.76 cm-1 and 4.28 eV. The bandgap expressed in Joule is 400 kJ/mole. The small drop at 800 nm is because of the change of source and detector. The combined spectrum shows that the IR cutoff for sodalime silcate is 4700 nm</p>
<p>The refractive index is calulcated based on the formular <span class="math inline">\(n = \frac {(1+ℝ)}{(1-ℝ)}\)</span> where R is the percent refelction and $ℝ = \sqrt \frac {R}{2} $.</p>

The region between 2500 nm to 800 nm is mostly flat but has slightly decreasing tendency. This is because the index of refraction increases with decreasing wavelength.

<h4>
Sample : As2S3
</h4>
<p>Compared to the spectrum of soda lime silicate glass, As2S3 is seen to be shifted down. This is because of increased reflection and higher index of refraction. More electrons are easily polarized because the binding energy of sulphide anion is greater than oxide anion. Also the index of refraction increases more rapidly with decreasing wavelength than for sodalime silicate glass. The cutoff occurs at visible wavelength range at 560 nm or 0.56 microns or 17857.14 cm-1 or 2.22 eV. Absorption peaks at 4000 and 6660 nm correspond to the bond vibrations of As and S. The IR cutoff occurs at 13363 nm. </p>

<h4>
Sample : As2Se3
</h4>
<p>The spectrum of As2Se3 occurs further below that of As2S3. This is because of the high polarizability of the selenide anion compared to oxide and sulphide. Corresponding its index of refraction is also higher than the other two. The cutoff for As2Se3 occurs at 780 nm or 0.78 microns or 12820.5 cm-1 or 1.59 eV. This is evident from the sample which is balck in color indicating that it absorbs most of the visible radiation. IR cutoff occurs at 12500 nm. Stron absorption peak are observed 15100 and 20500 nm corresponding to bond vibrations of Ar and Se. </p>

<h4>
Sample : Plastic film
</h4>
<p>A thin piece of plastic film was also used as a sample. The cutoff occurs at 315 nm ot 0.32 microns or 31746.03 cm-1 or 3.94 eV. The sample contains C-H and C-C bonds that vibrate at NIR wavelengths giving rise to multiple peaks.Therefore the IR cutoff can not be clearly observed.</p>
